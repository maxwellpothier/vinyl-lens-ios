# Vinyl Lens

You're in a record store and see an album cover you recognize, but you can't quite remember what the album is. Vinyl Lens uses your iPhone camera and AI to scan the record and helps you figure out what that album is. It gives you the title, artist, year it was released, and a generated description of the album's genre, themes, and background.
